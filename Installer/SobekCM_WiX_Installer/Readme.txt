NOTE: This project will cause warnings and not open in your Visual Studio unless
 you install the appropriate WiX Toolset.  This currently utilized Wix 3.6 library due
to issues with working with Wix3.7

You could also choose to ignore the warning if you are not going to be making a MSI file 
to install a custom version of the Builder.
